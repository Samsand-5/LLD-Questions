Given the sensitive nature of financial and personal information, Airbnb follows strict security measures:

Data Encryption: All sensitive data, including payment information and user credentials, is encrypted both at rest and in transit using TLS.

Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive parts of the system.

Compliance: Airbnb adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and other regional data protection laws, ensuring user data is handled responsibly.
