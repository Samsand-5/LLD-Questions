Airbnbâ€™s backend services are hosted on a cloud platform (AWS/GCP) to ensure scalability and high availability. Each microservice runs in its own container (via Docker), 
orchestrated by Kubernetes to handle traffic surges.

Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the API gateway and backend services, ensuring no single server gets overwhelmed.

CDN (Content Delivery Network): Used to cache static assets (property images, user profile photos) and serve them quickly to users, reducing latency.

Auto-scaling: The backend infrastructure automatically scales based on demand, ensuring smooth user experience during peak seasons without downtimes.
