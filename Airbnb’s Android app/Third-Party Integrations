Airbnbâ€™s Android app relies on several third-party services to ensure smooth operation:

Payment Gateway: External services like Stripe and PayPal securely handle payments. These gateways support multi-currency transactions and ensure compliance 
with global financial regulations.

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): FCM is used to deliver real-time notifications to users, ensuring they receive updates on bookings, trip reminders, or property promotions.

Google Maps API: Provides location-based services within the app, allowing users to search properties by map and get directions to their stays.
