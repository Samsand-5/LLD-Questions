Airbnbâ€™s backend is built on microservices architecture, where different services handle different business functions. This approach enables better scalability and 
isolation of concerns.

Authentication Service: Manages user registration, login, and session management. It integrates with third-party identity providers like Google and Facebook for 
single sign-on (SSO) functionality. Security is a priority, with two-factor authentication (2FA) and OAuth 2.0 for authorization.

Property Listing Service: This service manages all CRUD operations for property listings, including property details, availability, pricing, and images. Property data is 
stored in a NoSQL database like MongoDB for faster retrieval, while a search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) powers the filtering and searching functionalities.

Booking Service: Handles real-time booking, reservation management, and calendar synchronization. It uses an event-driven approach with message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) 
to handle high-throughput operations, ensuring that users can book stays without conflicts or double-bookings.

Payments Service: Integrates with multiple third-party payment providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process transactions securely. It supports various payment methods 
(credit cards, bank transfers, digital wallets) and ensures PCI compliance. The service also handles refunds, payment disputes, and currency conversions.

Notifications Service: Utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending push notifications to the Android app. This service notifies users about 
booking confirmations, reminders, or promotions.

Reviews Service: This service manages the reviews and rating system. It allows users to leave reviews for properties and hosts after their stays. 
To maintain trust, the review system is backed by moderation services, which detect and remove inappropriate or fake reviews.

Search & Recommendations Service: A dedicated service using Elasticsearch and machine learning algorithms. This service provides personalized property recommendations based on 
user behavior, preferences, and past bookings.
