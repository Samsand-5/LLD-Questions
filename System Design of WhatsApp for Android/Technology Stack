Message Protocol: WhatsApp uses a highly optimized protocol based on XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), supporting asynchronous communication, 
making it perfect for real-time messaging.

Event-driven Architecture: Events (like message receipt) trigger updates in real time, keeping users connected and in sync.
