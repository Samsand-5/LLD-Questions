WhatsAppâ€™s emphasis on security is evident through its use of end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This means that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.

End-to-End Encryption: WhatsApp leverages the Signal Protocol, which uses unique keys for each message. Only the sender and recipient have the necessary keys to 
decrypt the messages.

Key Exchange: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange ensures secure key sharing between users without exposing the keys over the network.

User Authentication: WhatsApp authenticates users via their phone number and links this with a public-private key pair, ensuring secure communication.
