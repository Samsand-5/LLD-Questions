WhatsApp leverages both local and server-side databases to ensure data integrity and synchronization:

Local Database: WhatsApp uses SQLite to store chat histories, contacts, and sent messages locally, providing quick access even when offline.

Server-side Database: To handle billions of messages daily, WhatsApp employs a sharded database architecture, where each shard handles a subset of users.

Sharding Mechanism:
User Sharding: Users are divided across database shards based on their ID. This method allows horizontal scaling, ensuring that the load is distributed across multiple databases.

Replication and Backup: WhatsApp uses replication to keep databases synchronized across multiple servers, preventing data loss and providing redundancy.
