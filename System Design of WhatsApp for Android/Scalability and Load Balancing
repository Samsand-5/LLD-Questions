Handling billions of messages daily requires a scalable architecture. WhatsApp ensures this through:

Horizontal Scaling: The workload is distributed across multiple servers. If demand increases, more servers are added, ensuring that the system can handle 
higher loads without slowing down.

Load Balancing: Load balancers distribute traffic evenly across different servers, preventing any server from becoming overwhelmed and ensuring that 
users experience minimal delays.
