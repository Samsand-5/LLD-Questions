The core of WhatsApp is its messaging system, which allows users to send messages quickly and reliably.

Key Design Aspects:
Queue-based Messaging: Messages are queued and sent to the server. The server temporarily stores the message until the recipient comes online.

Delivery Status: WhatsApp uses a simple system:

Single tick: Message sent to the server.

Double tick: Message delivered to the recipient.

Blue tick: Message read by the recipient.

Messages are stored on the server until theyâ€™re delivered and then deleted for security.
