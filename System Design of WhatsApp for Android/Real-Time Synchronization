WhatsApp ensures synchronization across devices via background sync services:

Push Notifications: Androidâ€™s Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) system is used to push notifications when a new message arrives.

Persistent WebSocket Connections: WebSockets ensure real-time message receipt, enabling low-latency communication between clients and servers.

If the WebSocket connection is interrupted, the app automatically reconnects and syncs any undelivered data with the server.
