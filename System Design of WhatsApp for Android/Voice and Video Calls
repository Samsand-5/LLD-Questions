WhatsAppâ€™s voice and video calling features are built using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology.

WebRTC: Used for real-time peer-to-peer communication for voice and video calls.

ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment): Enables calls to be established even when users are behind NAT (Network Address Translation).

TURN/STUN Servers: These servers help negotiate the call connection and ensure smooth communication over the network.
