WhatsApp allows users to share media such as images, videos, and audio. Handling large files efficiently requires optimization:

Compression: Media files are compressed before being uploaded, reducing bandwidth usage and speeding up transfer times.

Cloud Storage: Media files are temporarily stored in cloud servers (e.g., AWS S3) until theyâ€™re delivered to the recipient.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN is used to distribute media files globally, minimizing download time based on user location.
